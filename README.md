# ComicTraining
Personal learning project. I use this project to practice some concepts used in iOS programming. 
This app makes requests on the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/) requesting for marvel characters, parses them and shows information about them once they're clicked.

## Prerequisites

XCode, Cocoapods and keys to use the Marvel API
